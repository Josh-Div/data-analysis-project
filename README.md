# data-analysis-project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a project showcasing my data analysis and visualization skills. The project includes:
- DataFrame creation using pandas
- Data cleaning and data wrangling
- Graph plotting using pandas
- A dashboard built in Power BI

## DataFrame Creation
The dataset consists of information about various individuals, including:
- Name, Age, Profession, Salary, Company, and more.

## Data Cleaning
We handled missing data and performed data preprocessing steps such as filling null values, correcting column types, and cleaning the data for visualization.

## Data Visualization in Power BI
After cleaning the data, visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines were created to uncover insights.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install necessary dependencies (e.g., pandas, Power BI).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or script for the data analysis steps.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for graphing
